# Development and Comparison of Open Set Classification Techniques on ImageNet

This repository is associated with my [Master Thesis](https://www.merlin.uzh.ch/publication/show/22689) at the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) Group in the Department of Informatics at the University of Zurich. In this thesis, I conduct a systematic comparison of four relevant Open Set algorithms. The repository mirrors the original project structure on the IfI server **rolf** and consists of the following directories:

- [**code**](https://github.com/miksut/open_set_recognition/tree/main/code): contains the source code that builds the foundation of the comparison of the algorithms. This source code is organised in form of two Python packages (_eosa_ and _imageNet_protocols_). For more information on those packages as well as on running the experiments, please refer to the directory _code_.

- [**data**](https://github.com/miksut/open_set_recognition/tree/main/data): most importantly, this directory hosts the protocol-specific csv files that contain the access information necessary for loading the datasets. These files are not uploaded to GitLab as they can simply be generated by running the script [_prepare_protocols.py_](https://github.com/miksut/open_set_recognition/blob/main/code/eosa/eosa/experiments/prepare_protocols.py).

- [**results**](https://github.com/miksut/open_set_recognition/tree/main/results): comprises various files that are linked to the final results. For more information on these files, please refer to the respective subdirectories.
