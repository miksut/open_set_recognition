# Development and Comparison of Open Set Classification Techniques on ImageNet

This repository is associated with my [Master Thesis](https://www.merlin.uzh.ch/publication/show/22689) at the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) Group in the Department of Informatics at the University of Zurich. In this thesis, I conduct a systematic comparison of four relevant Open Set algorithms. The repository mirrors the original project structure on the IfI server **rolf** and consists of the following directories:

- **code**: contains the source code that builds the foundation of the comparison of the algorithms. This source code is organised in form of two Python packages (_eosa_ and _imageNet_protocols_). For more information on those packages as well as on running the experiments, please refer to the directory _code_.

- **data**: most importantly, this directory hosts the protocol-specific csv files that contain the access information necessary for loading the datasets. These files are not uploaded to GitLab as they can simply be generated by running the script [_prepare_protocols.py_](https://gitlab.ifi.uzh.ch/aiml/theses/master-suter/-/blob/msuter-main-patch-32656/code/eosa/eosa/experiments/prepare_protocols.py).

- **results**: comprises various files that are linked to the final results. For more information on these files, please refer to the respective subdirectories.
