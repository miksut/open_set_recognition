This directory hosts the protocol-specific csv files that contain the access information necessary for loading the datasets.

Note: These files are not uploaded to GitLab as they can simply be generated by running the script [_prepare_protocols.py_](https://gitlab.ifi.uzh.ch/aiml/theses/master-suter/-/blob/msuter-main-patch-32656/code/eosa/eosa/experiments/prepare_protocols.py).
